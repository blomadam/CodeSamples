    "Tonight Jen and I did some thinking about the Monty Hall puzzle, which is based on a theoretical gameshow.  The game begins with three doors, behind one of which is a car. The other two doors hide \"goats\".  The host knows which door hides the car, and uses this knowledge to make the game more interesting (and help you out in the process).  The game runs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Host shows player three doors (labeled A,B,C) and says he knows which door hides a car\n",
    "2. Player picks 1 of three doors (ex: door C)\n",
    "3. Host opens a different door showing a goat (ex: door A)\n",
    "4. Having revealed the location of one of the goats, the host asks the player if they would like to change their choice to the other remaining door.\n",
    "5. Player stays or switches according to a strategy\n",
    "6. Host opens final choice door revealing the prize (or lack thereof)\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of this puzzle is a question of the strategy used in step 5.  Should the player:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always stay with original door\n",
    "2. Always switch to the other door\n",
    "3. Randomly choose to stay or switch (i.e. flip a coin)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy chosen will result in significant differences in the probability of winning the car.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The odds may seem rather counter intuitive at first, but can be rationalized as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal strategy fully utilizes the information the host shows when opening one of the doors.  The host knows where the car is, so they will never reveal the car.  This imparts more knowledge than just opening one of the other doors at random.  One can understand what is going on here by enumerating all the possible outcomes of the game, depending on the player's initial choice, the car location, and which door is revealed. Note that the host has a choice of which door to reveal only if the player happens to pick the door holding the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. choose A, car A, reveal B or C\n",
    "2. choose A, car B, reveal C\n",
    "3. choose A, car C, reveal B\n",
    "4. choose B, car A, reveal C\n",
    "5. choose B, car B, reveal A or C\n",
    "6. choose B, car C, reveal A\n",
    "7. choose C, car A, reveal B\n",
    "8. choose C, car B, reveal A\n",
    "9. choose C, car C, reveal A or B\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 9 possibilities.  One might initially think there should be twelve choices rather than nine, since the host has a choice of doors to reveal in three of the scenarios.  This is not the case. The host already knows all of the information and so there is no uncertainty added through their choice.  They will never choose incorrectly.  The host can have a choice of doors to open, but this is merely revealing information, not creating possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the player chooses the \"stay\" strategy, there are three winning outcomes, which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. choose A, car A, reveal B or C\n",
    "2. <del>choose A, car B, reveal C</del>\n",
    "3. <del>choose A, car C, reveal B</del>\n",
    "4. <del>choose B, car A, reveal C</del>\n",
    "5. choose B, car B, reveal A or C\n",
    "6. <del>choose B, car C, reveal A</del>\n",
    "7. <del>choose C, car A, reveal B</del>\n",
    "8. <del>choose C, car B, reveal A</del>\n",
    "9. choose C, car C, reveal A or B\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of winning using the \"stay\" strategy are 3/9 or 33%\n",
    "\n",
    "If the player choses the random strategy, this is akin to ignoring the game before the first reveal.  Sure one door in three was originally chosen, but now the choice is between just two doors, improving the odds.  A random choice from two wins 50% of the time.  Much better than 33%, but one can still do (quite a bit) better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"switching\" strategy relies on the host's knowledge of where the car is to maximize the odds.  Since the host will never reveal the car, odds are they did not have a choice on which door to reveal (they were forced to reveal a specific door unless the player chose correctly on the first try).  So this strategy amounts to the player betting that they were wrong in the first round.  Since the odds of guessing the first door correctly are 1 in 3,  betting against that doubles the chances of winning to 2/3 (67%).  This is shown in the possible outcome list with the losing options removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <del>choose A, car A, reveal B or C</del>\n",
    "2. choose A, car B, reveal C\n",
    "3. choose A, car C, reveal B\n",
    "4. choose B, car A, reveal C\n",
    "5. <del>choose B, car B, reveal A or C</del>\n",
    "6. choose B, car C, reveal A\n",
    "7. choose C, car A, reveal B\n",
    "8. choose C, car B, reveal A\n",
    "9. <del>choose C, car C, reveal A or B</del>\n",
    "\n",
    "Six of the nine scenarios are clearly winning outcomes from the \"switching\" strategy.  A 67% chance of winning is a sizable improvment over the original 33% one had if they remained with their initial choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One can test this line of reasoning with a simple experiment.  For an empirical test, gather a die, three cards, and a penny. Roll the die in order to determine under which card the penny will be hidden (1-2=A, 3-4=B, 5-6=C).  Roll the die again to determine which card the player chooses.  Eiether eliminate the remaining losing card (if the player chooses incorrectly initially) or roll the die to determine which losing card is eliminated (divide the die by odd and even numbers for 2 outcome choices).  Pick a choosing strategy.  If staying with initial choice or always switching the game ends.  If randomly determining the strategy roll the die and proceed.  Repeat ad nauseum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can use the following python program to quickly tally thousands of results."
