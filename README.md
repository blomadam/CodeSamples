# CodeSamples

This repository contains some samples from my coding projects.

- monty-hall.ipynb describes an interesting mathematical situation known as the Monty Hall paradox with an example simulation in python.
- demo_chi2.py is an example implementation of a "Monte Carlo" fitting algorithm I wrote to graphically verify results from a Minuit fitting routine used to extract data for my thesis.
	+ demo.db is a database of cross section data polled in the python script.
	+ lookuptable.dat is a flat file database of DR model cross section predictions to compare to the experimental data.
- MAID_script.sh is an ETL bash script written to extract MAID model data from a website, format it for look up, and load it into a flat file database to be used in the analysis code.
	+ MAID_sample_lookuptable.dat is an section of the table generated by the script.
- interpolation_test.* are two implementations of cubic interpolation routines for use in Monte Carlo simulations of detector hardware.
	+ VCSlookup_sample.dat is the beginning of a look up table to demonstrate the structure.
